# World Wide Nexus
The official repo of the World Wide Nexus standards.

The idea of WWN is to standardize how virtual spaces and experiences are made, giving everyone the opportunity to develop and build incredible experiences that are as accessible as a website today.

We believe that all the necessary elements already exist for the initial creation of the so called "metaverse", and all our work is highly influenced by current internet standards, altho we know there are flaws and we plan to avoid those as we build the nexus.

If you would like to help, this is the list of things to be looked at and it shall be up to date.

This may also be known as the World Wide Metaverse, but due to the preconceptions and miss use of the "metaverse" word, we opted to use the word "nexus" instead.
