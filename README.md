# World Wide Nexus
The official repo of the World Wide Nexus standards.

The idea of WWN is to standardize how virtual spaces and experiences are made, giving everyone the opportunity to develop and build incredible experiences that are as accessible as a website today.

We believe that all the necessary elements already exist for the initial creation of the so called "metaverse", and all our work is highly influenced by current internet standards, altho we know there are flaws and we plan to avoid those as we build the nexus.

If you would like to help, this is the list of things to be looked at the moment:
- Start the definition of the HON standard (WIP)
- Start the definition of the HOL Script Language (WIP)
- Start the definition of the HOP Language - To be fair we still dont know if its necessary, since backend languages are very good nowadays, we need to think about it more...
- Start the definition of the SHADE Language - This needs to be thought on a high level, should it be only a shader language? If so, we should keep it to current standards? Maybe SHADE could be a new level of abstraction? Anyway, current graphical engines need the shader code to be pre-compiled, maybe SHADE will only be valid on a 100% authoral engine?
- Create tutorials
- Create Demos

This may also be known as the World Wide Metaverse, but due to the preconceptions and miss use of the "metaverse" word, we opted to use the word "nexus" instead.
